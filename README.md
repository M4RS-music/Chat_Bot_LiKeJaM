# Chat_Bot_LiKeJaM
## README
This is a small Chatbot that is meant to provide information about the parks in Prague in an interactive way. The objective is for it to be able of provide the user an ELIZA like experience that provides information about the park such as any interesting features accessibility and more. For this purpose the bot will be programed in Clojure.

## HOW TO USE
To run the chatbot navigate to /Chat_Bot_LiKeJaM with your command line and run:
*clojure chat_bot_main.clj*

To communicate with the chatbot simply type a question pertaining to info on a
park. Do not use accents for the names of the parks. The chatbot will not reply to questions it does not have the
information for.

You can also ask the chatbot to help you identify a bird and it will guide you
through a short taxonomy of the local species.

To exit the chatbot type:
*Goodbye*
