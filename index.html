  <p>string_to_vector now outputs a vector of the users inputted words.
    normalize_string does not yet work however the regex match has been written and string made lowercase.
    --Martin Janda Nov 20, 2020 12:25-1pm</p>
  <p>normalize_string:
    re-matches appears to be a broken function in clojure. I replaced it with
    re-find after some research and now the removal of punctuation and capitalization works.
    --Martin Janda 21 Nov, 2020 9:45-9:55am</p>
  <p>Started working on the responses. Created the first responses.

    --Kevin Dhembi Nov 22, 2020 8:00-9:00pm</p>
  <p>Major progress on the responses. Created vectors that allow the proccess_input function. Most of the work done.
    --Kevin Dhembi Nov 23, 2020 10:00pm-12:00am</p>
  <p>decision_tree_mock_up:

Created sets of keywords.
Created debug functions for generation of responses to keywords.
Added most conditions to detect_keywords.
Connected dialougue_loop to detect_keywords.

  <p>Chatbot now replies to all questions regarding info on bertramka --Martin JAnda 1 Dec, 2020 6-7:11pm</p>

  <p>Fix multiple keyword detection:
    Chatbot no longer generates more than one reply for the same info if it detects more than one keyword for that info in the user input.

<h2>Woklogs for ICA1 Below</h2>
<p>The chatbot now can give information about all parks in the data structure parks_info. This is accomplished
  by the new detect_keywords_init function which checks whether the name of a park is in the user input. if no
   park has been mentioned in the conversation the chatbot will prompt the user to specify a park. If the chatbot
  detects a park all further questions will correspond to that park untill the user asks about a different park.
added arr_contains? this normalizes an arr while it checks for the presence of a string within it.
fixed dialogue_loop spelling mistake
dialogue_loop calls detect_keywords_init instead of detect_keywords.

--MARTIN JANDA Jan 13, 2020 9am-11:55am</p>
<p> Add detection of dog identification topic

topic_handler (formerly detect_keywords_init) can now detect if the user wants to identify a dog, it runs the function dog_taxonomy which will be a decision tree that will guide the user through a series of binary questions that will identify a dog breed (or a dog likely being a breed since we will not be identifying every breed)

--MARTIN JANDA Jan 14, 2020 1:30-1:59pm</p>
<p>Preliminary version of the decision tree created.
Capable of identifying 8 species of bird common in prague for now.

!!The chatbot does not yet identify birds the decision tree merely contains the data for identifying them.

--MARTIN JANDA Jan 15, 2021 2:30-3:40pm</p>
<p>Initial bird_taxonomy function created
Currently does not actually return questions or answers from the tree, however the logic for taking the user through the tree is there. The issue is that the positition in tree is not being printed correctly.

--Martin Janda Jan 20, 2021 10:00-10:53am </p>
<p>Bird decision tree now works and identifies bird based on decision tree.

--MARTIN JANDA Jan 20, 2021 12:00-12:22pm</p>
<p>Inserted all birds into decision tree
  Decision tree now contains all birds commonly found in prague. Chatbot now exits on "exit" or "q"
