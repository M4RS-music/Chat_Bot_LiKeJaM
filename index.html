    --Martin Janda Nov 3, 2020 11:30pm - 12:00am</p>
  <p>Process_input_main now recognizes questions vs. statements and calls
    process_input_statement or process_input_question respectively.
    --Martin Janda Nov 4, 2020 10:30-11am</p>
  <p>string_to_vector now outputs a vector of the users inputted words.
    normalize_string does not yet work however the regex match has been written and string made lowercase.
    --Martin Janda Nov 20, 2020 12:25-1pm</p>
  <p>normalize_string:
    re-matches appears to be a broken function in clojure. I replaced it with
    re-find after some research and now the removal of punctuation and capitalization works.
    --Martin Janda 21 Nov, 2020 9:45-9:55am</p>
  <p>Started working on the responses. Created the first responses.
    --Kevin Dhembi Nov 21, 2020 10:00-11:30pm</p>
  <p>Continuous work on the responses of the program.
    --Kevin Dhembi Nov 22, 2020 8:00-9:00pm</p>
  <p>Major progress on the responses. Created vectors that allow the proccess_input function. Most of the work done.

  <p>Corrected some minor mistakes on the responses. Job done.

      project worklog and I will add it to the github page (or you guys can too)
      --Martin Janda 25 Nov, 2020 12:30-12:45pm</p>
    <p>detect_keywords:
      the detect keywords loop has now been layed out.
      --Martin Janda 27 Nov, 2020 10:20-10:46am</p>
  <p> Major progress toward dialogue

Merged decision_tree.clj to chat_bot_main.clj to not deal with namespaces in repl when testing.
Made minor fixes to replies. (mising colons and spaces)
Created sets of keywords.
Created debug functions for generation of responses to keywords.
Added most conditions to detect_keywords.
Connected dialougue_loop to detect_keywords.
Phased out proccess_input nonsense :P

You can now ask this chatbot questions about betramka and it will tell you what type of reply it will give you.

--Martin Janda 27 Nov, 2020 6:00-7:35pm </p>
  <p>Complete Keyword Detection Framework
    All forseeable questions regarding data on the park are now recognized by the chatbot.

--Martin Janda 28 Nov, 2020 7:20-8:20pm</p>
  <p>Chatbot now replies to all questions regarding info on bertramka --Martin JAnda 1 Dec, 2020 6-7:11pm</p>

  <p>Fix multiple keyword detection:
    Chatbot no longer generates more than one reply for the same info if it detects more than one keyword for that info in the user input.
