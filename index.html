    --Martin Janda Oct 28, 2020 8pm - 8.45pm</p>
  <p>Create park_info data structure and input the required 1 park for this ICA1
    --Martin Janda Nov 1, 2020 10:30 - 11:20 am</p>
  <p>Added helper functions and predicates for easily accessing parks_info.
    --Martin Janda Nov 3, 2020 11:30pm - 12:00am</p>
  <p>Process_input_main now recognizes questions vs. statements and calls
    process_input_statement or process_input_question respectively.
    --Martin Janda Nov 4, 2020 10:30-11am</p>
  <p>string_to_vector now outputs a vector of the users inputted words.
    normalize_string does not yet work however the regex match has been written and string made lowercase.
    --Martin Janda Nov 20, 2020 12:25-1pm</p>
  <p>normalize_string:
    re-matches appears to be a broken function in clojure. I replaced it with
    re-find after some research and now the removal of punctuation and capitalization works.
    --Martin Janda 21 Nov, 2020 9:45-9:55am</p>
  <p>Create github page:
      created the github page and added the worklog to it, continue adding to the
      project worklog and I will add it to the github page (or you guys can too)
