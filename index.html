<h1>LiKeJaM Chatbot</h1>
<p>This is the github page for the chatbot ICA</p>
<h2>Woklogs Bellow</h2>
  <p>Create basic chat loop.
    --Martin Janda Oct 28, 2020 8pm - 8.45pm</p>
  <p>Create park_info data structure and input the required 1 park for this ICA1
    --Martin Janda Nov 1, 2020 10:30 - 11:20 am</p>
  <p>Added helper functions and predicates for easily accessing parks_info.
    --Martin Janda Nov 3, 2020 11:30pm - 12:00am</p>
  <p>Process_input_main now recognizes questions vs. statements and calls
    process_input_statement or process_input_question respectively.
    --Martin Janda Nov 4, 2020 10:30-11am</p>
  <p>string_to_vector now outputs a vector of the users inputted words.
    normalize_string does not yet work however the regex match has been written and string made lowercase.
    --Martin Janda Nov 20, 2020 12:25-1pm</p>
  <p>normalize_string:
    re-matches appears to be a broken function in clojure. I replaced it with
    re-find after some research and now the removal of punctuation and capitalization works.
    --Martin Janda 21 Nov, 2020 9:45-9:55am</p>
  <p>Create github page:
      created the github page and added the worklog to it, continue adding to the
      project worklog and I will add it to the github page (or you guys can too)
      --Martin Janda 25 Nov, 2020 12:30-12:45pm</p>
    <p>detect_keywords:
      the detect keywords loop has now been layed out.
      --Martin Janda 27 Nov, 2020 10:20-10:46am</p>
  <p> Major progress toward dialogue

Merged decision_tree.clj to chat_bot_main.clj to not deal with namespaces in repl when testing.
Made minor fixes to replies. (mising colons and spaces)
Created sets of keywords.
Created debug functions for generation of responses to keywords.
Added most conditions to detect_keywords.
Connected dialougue_loop to detect_keywords.
Phased out proccess_input nonsense :P

You can now ask this chatbot questions about betramka and it will tell you what type of reply it will give you.
